# AdpInEKF
AdpInEKF for 3D point cloud localization, in which the points of a 3D point cloud set are directly used for measurements to update the predicted state, and any registration algorithms can be employed for the data association process. The states are estimated via Invariant EKF,  which as a stable nonlinear observer has particularly suited for state estimation in Lie Group
