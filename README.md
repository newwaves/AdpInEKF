# AdpInEKF
AdpInEKF for 3D point cloud localization, in which the points of a 3D point cloud set are directly used to measurements to update the predicted state, and any registration algorithms can be employed to  data association process. The states are estimated via Invariant EKF,  which as a stable nonlinear observer has partcularly suited for state estimation in Lie Group
